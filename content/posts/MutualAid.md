## Introduction

Mutual aid requests are critical to the survival of chronically ill and/or disabled people. Being disabled and sick is expensive, and benefits are almost never enough to cover the cost of living and medical expenses which are outright extortion in the United States.

Detailed below are mutual aid requests for chronically ill and/or disabled people.

I am currently collecting disability payments from my work insurance and appealing my claim for Federal disability, but it is a constant struggle making ends meet. Hence, the constant crowdfunding."
