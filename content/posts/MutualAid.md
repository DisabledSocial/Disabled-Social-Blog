## Introduction

Mutual aid requests are critical to the survival of chronically ill and/or disabled people. Being disabled and sick is expensive, and benefits are almost never enough to cover the cost of living and medical expenses which are outright extortion in the United States.

Detailed below are mutual aid requests for chronically ill and/or disabled people.

## How to be Added

You do NOT need to be on the disabled.social server to have your request added. If you would like to add your request, please get in contact with us via DM with the following information:
