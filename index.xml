Introduction Content warnings are a way of alerting a reader to potentially distressing content. It is a way of creating consent by giving the user the choice of explicitly opting in or not to see specific forms of content.
Examples of content warnings: medical trauma, abuse, car accidents, suicidal ideation, nudity, etc.
When using content warnings, it is best to stick to general topical areas versus giving details, because the details themselves can be triggering.</description></item><item><title>Download Archive</title><link>https://disabledsocial.github.io/Disabled-Social-Blog/posts/guides/downloadarchive/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://disabledsocial.github.io/Disabled-Social-Blog/posts/guides/downloadarchive/</guid><description>Text-Only Instructions Within your account, you have the ability to download an archive of your account.
